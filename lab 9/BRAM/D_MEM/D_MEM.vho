-- The following code must appear in the VHDL architecture header:

------------- Begin Cut here for COMPONENT Declaration ------ COMP_TAG

-- COMP_TAG_END ------ End COMPONENT Declaration ------------

-- The following code must appear in the VHDL architecture
-- body. Substitute your own instance name and net names.

------------- Begin Cut here for INSTANTIATION Template ----- INST_TAG

-- You must compile the wrapper file D_MEM.vhd when simulating
